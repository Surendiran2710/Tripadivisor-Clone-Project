# Tripadivisor-Clone-Project

This project is a fully responsive clone of the TripAdvisor website, developed using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The goal of this project is to replicate the core functionalities and visual layout of the TripAdvisor platform, providing users with an engaging browsing experience.

# Key Features

Responsive Design:
The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries are employed to alter the layout based on the viewport size.

Flexbox Layout:
The use of CSS Flexbox allows for a flexible and efficient arrangement of elements within the layout. This simplifies the alignment and distribution of space among items in a container, leading to a more organized design.

Display Properties and Positioning:
The project utilizes various CSS display properties (such as block, inline-block, and flex) to control how elements are rendered on the page. Positioning techniques (relative, absolute, and fixed) are applied to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

Media Queries: 
Specific media queries are implemented to enhance the website's responsiveness. These queries adjust styles for different screen widths, ensuring that the layout remains user-friendly regardless of the device being used.

# Technologies Used

HTML: The structure of the web pages is built using semantic HTML, ensuring accessibility and SEO optimization. CSS: Styling is accomplished through CSS, with a focus on Flexbox for layout management, along with media queries for responsive behavior.
